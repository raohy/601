## Multi-View Stereo
Multi-view stereo (MVS) is the general term given to a group of techniques that use stereo correspondence as their main cue and use more than two images. MVS originated as a natural improvement to the two-view case. In the two-view case, we search the similarity between two images and .Instead of capturing two photographs from two dif- ferent viewpoints, multi-view stereo would capture more viewpoints in-between to increase robustness. And Usually model a 3D object.

Until this day, two-view stereo algo- rithms have been a very active and fruitful research area. With the improvement of hardware and the structure-from-motion(SFM), Multi-view stereo came into the eyes. MVS gradually step into the industry from the lab.
Its applications range from 3D mapping and navigation to online shopping, 3D printing, computational photography, computer video games, or cultural heritage archival.

The goal of an image-based 3D reconstruction algorithm can be de- scribed as ”given a set of photographs of an object or a scene, estimate
the most likely 3D shape that explains those photographs, under the assumptions of known materials, viewpoints, and lighting conditions” (See Figure 1.1).
