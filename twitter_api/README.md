# Twitter API
In this part, I used Twitter api to get tweets of public feelings about the weather in Boston in the past week. I use the key words to limit the tweets I get to boston, weather and ask it not to contain #boston tag to remove weather forecasts, pictures, links, and video. The query was encoded by the http protocal. Finally I get a total of 144 tweets Information, as shown in data.csv. And save the obtained information into txt and csv files for subsequent Google nlp processing. It is worth mentioning that error handling has been done for tweet messages when the API is not responding and encounting verification failures. If an error occurs, it will not affect the normal operation of the program.
# Google NLP API
Through Google’s AutoML Natural Language service, I used the twitter information to train a network about the citizens’ emotional towards the weather. In this process, I created an emotion recognition model, and set three recognition levels: 0 means unhappiness, 1 means neutral, and 2 means pleasure. I marked the 144 tweets, of which 40 were unhappy, 77 were neutral, and 51 were pleasure and stored the established data set into the model for training. The final training results are shown below.
